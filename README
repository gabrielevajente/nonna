Non-stationary Noise Analysis (NonNA) - Gabriele Vajente - version 2015-06-09

Compute the band-limited RMS of a signal in a given band, and try to make the best
possible prediction of its slow time variation using a set of auxiliary channels.
The script nonna.py is an example of how to use the NonNA functions. It produces 
two output plots:
  1) time series of the BLRMS and best fit obtained with the auxiliary channels
  2) ranking of the channels, in terms of how much they contribute to the reduction of
     the error in the prediction

Most of the configuration parameters are in lines 20-53.
